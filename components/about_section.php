                            <p><span>Empower rural families with knowledge, skills and resources that improve their living standards</span></p>
                            <p>SAFI began in 2002 as community-based organization that was set up to coordinate the food relief assistance in response to the severe famine that hit Malawi in that year. As time went by, the founders realized that provision of food relief items was not sustainable in the long-term. It was felt that a sustainable solution to food insecurity was to capacitate households so that they can produce all the food they need hence SAFI was established and commenced its operations in 2007 with its first cohort of 30 families. Today, SAFI has trained over 300 families on its campus in Madisi, Dowa district. </p>
